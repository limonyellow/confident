Confident
=========

**Confident** helps you create configuration objects from multiple sources such as files and environment variables.
Confident config objects are data models that enforce validation and type hints by using `pydantic <https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/>`_ library.

With Confident you can manage multiple configurations depend on the environment your code is deployed.
While having lots of flexibility how to describe your config objects, Confident will provide visibility of the process
and help you expose misconfiguration as soon as possible.
